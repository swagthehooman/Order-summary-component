## Overview
This is a solution to the [Order summary card challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/order-summary-component-QlPmajDUj). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this order summary card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

## My process

First job was to disect the design and learn what kind of styles are used, when the transitions will happen, UX of the design, etc. As a second step, creation of widget/ component tree was done. It's very critical as this will complete 50% of the job. Post completion of design learning process, it's all about css styling which was very easy for me at this point.

### Built with

I used custom css and html 5 for this challenge. Although react js would have made life easier, I chose not to (just for fun sake and also, because I'm still learning it :) ).

### What I learned

So many things I learned with this challenge.
- use of flex box
- custom button styling
- centering divs
- hover effects
- padding and margin behaviours
